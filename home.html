      <p>A/B testing is a method of comparing two versions of a product, which uses
      statistical analysis of users' behavior to evaluate the difference between the two
    variants. In this project, I performed an A/B test on two versions of a cactus e-commerce site.
    I wanted to test if a tiered pricing scheme changed users' behavior. </p>

    <p>You can visit the site <a href="https://sleepy-ridge-49071.herokuapp.com/">here</a>.
    Refresh the page to see a different version!</p>

    <p>My hypothesis was that a tiered pricing scheme would make users take longer to
    make purchase decisions. Additionally, I hypothesized that users might be unsure about
  what price tier they want, so they'd be more like to return to the listings once they reached
the checkout page.</p>

    <p>I collected Heroku logs from the activity of 22 users in my class, and used Python
    to perform analysis of the data, specifically using t- and chi-squared statistical tests.</p>

  <p>I decided to present my results in an infographic to be more engaging: </p>

    <p>Here are some of my takeaways from this project:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>This analysis was strongly limited by the small amout of data collected.
      I suspect that these tests would have derected a difference between these sites
    if I was able to collect more samples.</li>
    <li>Large tech companies, with access to millions of new data points every day, have
    enormous power when it comes to iterative design. Facebook could show a new button
  to a tiny fraction of its users, and achieve meaningful results about its performance.</li>
  <li>I wonder if iterative design could be an automated process in the future, where
  an AI could come up with a new design, test it, and learn from the results.</li>
  </ul>
